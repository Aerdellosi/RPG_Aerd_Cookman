            <h1>The blessing of MiwuZhiya</h1>
            <p>From the dreams of Dutch royalty and the purses of many bankers, the Dutch have sent dozens of explorers out on a mission to establish trading ties with the Ming empire. You are one of those explorers, a dashingly handsome, brave and learned man of the sea. During a voyage into uncharted waters, your boat defeats and commandeers a small waco vessel. In exchange for his life, the waco captain gives you written instructions to find the lost island of mist and plenty. At its peak sits a temple that contains a towering obelisk carved from the tail bone of an extinct elephant. If you kneel before the obelisk and chant the words "Mugi! Mugi! Ramma Yaya!" you'll be blessed with unchanging youth and bliss for an entire century. You accept his trade, take his instructions, and then make him walk the plank.</p>
            <p>On your journey to the island, your boat must pass through granite towers sticking out of a shallow bay. Navigating slowly, an enormous wave sneaks up behind your vessel and slams it into the rocks, shattering the hull. You keep your wits about you and climb to the crows nest, before diving into the water with an empty barrel in your hands. You live, but the sea becomes stormy. With the barrel you swim and drift through the waves until you pass over the reef. Through the rain you see an abandoned, oarless dingy. You swim up to it and pull yourself and the barrel into it, you then split the barrel and slowly use the planks to row yourself to shore. Exhausted and tired, you drag the boat on shore and look for items to take with you. You see many options. What do you decide to take?</p>
